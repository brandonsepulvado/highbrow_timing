## Directory Structure

The files in this repository use relative paths, so it might be helpful to review the directory strucure. In the primary highbrow_timing directory, you will find the R project file alongside code, data, and output folders (in addition to the .gitignore and README.md files). The code folder contains all of code to reproduce the analyses and data cleaning/manipulation used in this paper, and the output folder contains the output file (e.g., regression tables and visualizations). The data folder contains the 1973 Americans and the Arts survey way. We obtained the files from [ICPSR](). The survey data is provided from the site in .rda format, and we simply converted that file to .rds format. The code folder only needs to contain the .rds file

## Code

The code may be found in the code subdirectory. 

- `data_convert.R` is a short script that converts the original data file supplied by ICPSR into a .rds file and saves it within the data subdirectory.
